## What is dual/multi booting with boot loader utilities?
- boot loader is a system utility that is installed in Master Boot Record(MBR) in your hard disk
- Master Boot Loader is typically 512 bytes, hence the boot utility size will have fit within the 512 bytes
- Examples
  - LILO
  - GRUB 1
  - GRUB 2
- when a system is booted, the BIOS(Basic Input Output System) - POST(Power On Self Test) once completed, the BIOS will instruct the CPU to run the boot loader utility
- the boot loader utility then scans your hard disk looking for OS, if there are multiple OS installed on your system, then it gives a menu for you to choose the OS you wish to boot into
- though many OS can be installed only one OS can be active at point of time
