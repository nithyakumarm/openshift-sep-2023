## What is dual/multi booting with boot loader utilities?
- boot loader is a system utility that is installed in Master Boot Record(MBR) in your hard disk
- Master Boot Loader is typically 512 bytes, hence the boot utility size will have fit within the 512 bytes
- Examples
  - LILO
  - GRUB 1
  - GRUB 2
- when a system is booted, the BIOS(Basic Input Output System) - POST(Power On Self Test) once completed, the BIOS will instruct the CPU to run the boot loader utility
- the boot loader utility then scans your hard disk looking for OS, if there are multiple OS installed on your system, then it gives a menu for you to choose the OS you wish to boot into
- though many OS can be installed only one OS can be active at point of time

## What is Hypervisor?
- is virtualization technology
- supports running many Operating System on the same laptop/desktop/workstation/server
- many OS can be active at the same time
- hardware/software technology
- Processors
  - AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) - General Purpose Processors - Virtualization Feature is called AMD-V
  - Intel - General Purpose Processors - Virtualization Feature - VT-X
  - Apple Silicon(ARM Processor) - Embedded
- there are 2 types
  - Type 1
    - Bare-metal hypervisor
    - no OS is required to installed this type of Hypervisor
    - meant for Servers
  - Type 2
    -  For laptops/desktops/workstations
    -  requires Host OS ( could be any of these OS - Unix, Linux, Mac or Windows )
- this type of virtualization is called heavy-weight virtualization
  - because each Virtual machine has to be allocated with dedicated hardware resources
    - CPU Cores
    - RAM
    - Storage - Hard disk
    - Graphics Card
    - Network Card
- each Virtual machine represents one fully functional Operating System
- Examples
  - VMWare
    - Fusion ( Mac OS-X )
    - Workstation ( Linux & Windows )
    - vSphere/vCenter - Bare-metal Hypervisors
  - Oracle VirtualBox - Free works in Linux/Mac/Windows
  - Parallels ( Mac OS-X )
  - Microsoft Hyper-V
